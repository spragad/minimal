Sentiment analysis/ feedback analysis performed on e-commerce sites with the real-time data extracted from twitter. Pre-processing Data includes removing URLs, Emoji/Smiley, Mentions in tweets, Numbers, Punctuations, Extra spaces and Convert to lowercase. Word cloud is generated to get the mostly occuring word. Finding the sentiment scores using TextBlob and are classified as Strongly-Positive, Positive, Week-Positive, Neutral, Week -Negative, Negative, Strong-Negative. The results are visualised and Reported/presented.

A CNN model to classify an image with Cat or Dog.A CNN Model is trained with 5 'relu' layer and a 'sigmoid' layer to classify whether the given image contains a cat or a dog. This model is trained only for 20 epochs which resulted in 75% accurate model. Increasing the epochs to 300 or more with a custom Learning Rate can improve accuracy of the model.
